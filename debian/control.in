Description: UW IMAP4rev1 remote mail folder access server
 IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a method of accessing
 electronic messages kept on a (possibly shared) mail server.
 .
 The UW IMAP toolkit provides the c-client mail-handling library
 supporting various network transport methods, filesystem storage
 formats, and authentication and autorization methods.
 .
 NB! The Maildir storage format is currently not supported.
 .
 NB! Non-encrypted network transport is discouraged and requires special
 configuration of the c-client library to work.
 .
 This package contains imapd, an IMAP4rev1 server daemon which uses the
 c-client library.
