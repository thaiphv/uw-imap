Template: libc-client/plaintext
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Allow insecure authentication using plaintext passwords?
 The use of unencrypted plaintext passwords is generally insecure, and
 the current version of libc-client by default only allows network
 access through either TLS or SSL connections.  This affects uw-imapd,
 ipopd and any other programs that use libc-client for mail access
 through the network.  However, this functionality can be changed by
 using the semi-official /etc/c-client.cf configuration file.  Read more
 about this in /usr/share/doc/libc-client__VER__/README.Debian.

 Note: cramd-md5 passwords are treated as plaintext passwords!

Template: libc-client/no_maildir_warning
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Continue installing libc-client without Maildir support?
 Libc-client earlier than version 2002d (and development versions of
 2003) included an unofficial and no longer maintained patch to support
 Maildirs.
 By default Maildirs were not used by uw-imapd or ipopd, but if you have
 changed your system configuration or other installed programs depend on
 libc-client then upgrading may result in broken mail handling.

 Do you want to continue installing a libc-client without Maildir support?
