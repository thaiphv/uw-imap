# Description: Auto-update debian/control from debian/control.in
#  When the environment variable DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS contains the magic
#  string "update" the clean target is extended to auto-update
#  debian/control from debian/control.in where build-depends can contain
#  the magic string @cdbs@ expanded to build-dependencies known to cdbs,
#  and more...
#
#  In other words, with this in use don't edit debian/control directly,
#  but instead edit debian/control.in and invoke the following:
#    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=update fakeroot debian/rules clean
