# Description: Woody-compatible debconf template l12n
#  Usage: Add this to all debconf-using packages in debian/control:
#	Depends: ${debconf-depends} (where applicable)
#  If using debhelper.mk, make sure to include this first.
#  If not using debhelper.mk, something like the following should be
#  added to debian/rules:
#	dpkg-gencontrol -V'debconf-depends=debconf (>= $(PODEBCONF_MINDEBCONFVER))'
#  Based on this email by Colin Watson <cjwatson@flatline.org.uk>:

# Hack for woody compatibility. This makes sure that the
# debian/templates file shipped in the source package doesn't specify
# encodings, which woody's debconf can't handle. If building on a system
# with po-debconf installed (conveniently debhelper (>= 4.1.16) depends
# on it), the binary-arch target will generate a better version for
# sarge.
