Description: remote mail folder access server
 IMAP (the Interactive Mail Access Protocol) is a mechanism for
 accessing mail folders and the messages in them remotely, ie with
 your user mail program running on a different machine to the one
 where all the messages are stored.
 .
 If you do install uw-imapd you will almost certainly want to install a
 Mail Transfer Agent such as Smail or Sendmail, as remote mail
 programs which use IMAP to access incoming and saved mail will
 usually want to send mail using SMTP, often to the same machine.
 .
 This server has SSL support built in.
