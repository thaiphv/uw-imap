  * Drop Maildir patch. The code has always been buggy, is unsupported
    upstream and hasn't been maintained for several years. In addition,
    it may be the cause of security issues.
    The code and texts related to Maildir is kept in the source package
    for those interested in recompiling locally, but is no longer
    officially supported by Debian.

  * New upstream version.  SSL/TLS functionality is now built in so the
    old -ssl packages are obsolete.
  * WARNING: plaintext logins have been disabled for non SSL/TLS
    connections.  See /usr/share/doc/libc-client__VER__/README.Debian for
    further information. (Closes: #164454)
